# Electric ChemLab

Electric ChemLab is an interactive educational application designed to simulate electrolysis experiments in a 2D virtual lab environment. This project allows users to explore electrochemical phenomena by adjusting key experimental parameters and observing real-time chemical reactions.

## Overview

In Electric ChemLab, users can:
- Visualize the process of electrolysis in a classic Berzelius beaker filled with water.
- Interact with a simulated setup featuring two nails as electrodes connected to a power source (a DC battery placed underneath the beaker).
- Modify the current intensity and voltage supplied to the electrodes to see how these changes affect the experiment.
- Experiment with different electrolyte solutions and electrode materials.

The application is organized into two primary modes:
- **Open Experimentation:** Freely test various configurations, examine reaction efficiencies, and gain insights into the process.
- **Missions:** Complete specific challenges such as copper refining, hydrogen production, or chlorine generation, all while tracking experimental data and learning the underlying chemistry.

Animated visual feedback includes:
- Gas bubble generation
- Metal deposition on electrodes
- Color changes in the solution
- Real-time reaction rate monitoring

A built-in theoretical guide further explains the chemical processes at work, enhancing the educational value of each experiment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend development, if applicable)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (if the simulation or data visualization is Python-based)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ElectricChemLab.git
   cd ElectricChemLab
